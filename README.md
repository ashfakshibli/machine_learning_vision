# Machine Learning Vision
The path of my re-visiting basic concepts of problem solving in machine learning.




-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository shows how I struggled to learn Machine Learning because of not mastering problem solving.
I have jumped without deep knowledge of algorithm and data structures. Every mistake is a learning. So I went back to exercising algorithms, data structures and solving problems. From June 2024 I have started this again and hoping to organize things this time.
